# Kamooni Chat System Architecture

Developer architecture overview for the Mongo-native chat and notification-adjacent messaging model.

---

# 1. Purpose

Kamooni uses a Mongo-native chat backend.

The chat system supports:

- direct messages
- group conversations
- announcement/system conversations

The goal of this document is to explain how chat data is stored, normalized, authorized, rendered, and how unread messaging now relates to the Mail/Notifications split.

---

# 2. Core chat model

Main collections:

- chatConversations
- chatMessageDocs
- chatRoomMembers
- chatReadStates

Purpose of each:

chatConversations  
Stores conversation-level metadata.

chatMessageDocs  
Stores individual messages.

chatRoomMembers  
Stores group membership and membership status.

chatReadStates  
Stores read state / last-read tracking.

Important note:  
DMs and announcement conversations rely on participants lists.  
Groups additionally rely on membership records.

---

# 3. Conversation types

Supported conversation types:

- dm
- group
- announcement

Meaning:

dm  
Two-party direct conversation. Access is controlled by participants.

group  
Multi-user conversation. Access is controlled by membership.

announcement  
System-managed conversation. Access is controlled by participants, but replies are disabled.

Important invariant:

announcement conversations should behave like DM-style system threads, not like membership-controlled groups.

---

# 4. Conversation schema essentials

Stable fields used by chat conversations include:

- _id
- type
- participants
- circleId
- handle
- name
- description
- picture
- metadata
- createdAt
- updatedAt

These are contract-level fields between storage, normalization, and UI layers. They should not be casually renamed, removed, or restructured.

---

# 5. Message schema essentials

Stable fields used by chat messages include:

- _id
- conversationId
- senderDid
- body
- format
- source
- version
- system
- createdAt

System messages may include system metadata and may use markdown format.

---

# 6. Conversation normalization

Raw Mongo conversations are normalized before they reach the UI.

Relevant file:

- src/lib/data/mongo-chat.ts

Normalization maps Mongo records into `ChatRoomDisplay` objects used by the frontend.

Important top-level flags exposed to the UI include:

- conversationType
- repliesDisabled
- isDirect
- unreadCount

These flags matter because the UI should rely on stable normalized fields rather than parsing metadata ad hoc.

---

# 7. Authorization model

Access behavior differs by conversation type:

DM:  
authorized by participants list.

Announcement:  
authorized by participants list.

Group:  
authorized by membership records in `chatRoomMembers`, with inactive/removed/left memberships denied.

Relevant files:

- src/components/modules/chat/mongo-actions.ts
- src/lib/data/mongo-chat.ts

Important note:  
This distinction was critical for fixing announcement thread access.

---

# 8. Membership model

Group membership is enforced through `chatRoomMembers`.

Membership states such as `removed`, `left`, or inactive records should not grant access.

DM conversations do not depend on `chatRoomMembers`.

Incorrect membership assumptions can hide valid chats or expose chats that should be inaccessible.

---

# 9. Chat list rendering

`listConversationsForUser` performs conversation retrieval and display shaping.

Important behavior:

- conversation sync may run before list rendering
- DMs are visible based on participants
- announcements are visible like DMs
- groups are filtered by active membership
- ordering depends on updatedAt

Important invariant:

`chatConversations.updatedAt` must be updated on message send so sidebar ordering remains correct.

This is a critical system rule.

---

# 10. Message send pipeline

Relevant file:

- src/components/modules/chat/mongo-actions.ts

High-level send flow:

- resolve access
- validate reply target if present
- reject disallowed conversation types (announcement replies)
- create message
- update conversation timestamps and related state

Note:  
announcement replies are blocked server-side even if a UI path regresses.

---

# 11. Reply handling

Reply behavior by type:

- DM and group chats can reply
- announcement chats cannot reply
- UI hides reply controls for announcement threads
- server also blocks replies to announcement conversations

Relevant files:

- src/components/modules/chat/chat-room.tsx
- src/components/modules/chat/mongo-actions.ts

This is defense-in-depth: UI guidance plus server enforcement.

---

# 12. Read state and unread counts

Unread state is tracked through read-state primitives and conversation/message timestamps.

Relevant concepts:

- unread counts
- last-read timestamps
- read state updates when opening or reading conversations

Unread behavior is now split intentionally at the UI level:

**Mail icon**
- owns unread message activity
- DMs
- group unread
- help/contact thread unread

**Bell icon**
- does not own message unread
- owns non-message notifications only

This separation is intentional and should be preserved unless product direction changes.

---

# 13. Chat and notifications relationship

Chat and notifications are now related but distinct systems.

Chat remains the source of message content and message unread state.

Notifications are now stored separately in Mongo-backed notification records and surfaced through the Bell UI.

Important current behavior:

- PM-style notifications can be generated by chat events
- Bell excludes message notifications for launch
- message unread belongs to Mail, not Bell

This keeps Kamooni’s communication model high-signal and avoids duplicate alert surfaces.

---

# 14. Mentions

Current launch behavior:

- chat mentions are enabled and working
- non-chat mentions in posts/comments/discussions are intentionally disabled for launch

Reason:

Non-chat mention behavior was not stable enough for launch and should be rebuilt later using the working chat mention path as the implementation reference.

This is a deliberate launch tradeoff, not an accidental omission.

---

# 15. System messages inside chat

System messages are delivered through the same Mongo-native chat model.

Examples include:

- welcome messages
- platform broadcasts
- announcement threads

System messages are not a separate transport system; they are built on top of Mongo chat primitives.

---

# 17. Launch notes

Communication behavior at launch:

- Mail = messages
- Bell = non-message activity
- chat mentions work
- non-chat mentions are disabled
- notifications are in-app only for now
- notification settings are currently per circle/profile entity, not global
- notification settings currently control Bell-owned non-message activity only
- task/goal/proposal/issue notifications are role-relevant, not broadcast to everyone in a circle
- the notification settings MVP now reflects saved state immediately and no longer fabricates enabled defaults when settings are missing

Deferred work:

- simplify launch-facing notification categories
- web push delivery
- email fallback
- rebuilt non-chat mentions outside chat
