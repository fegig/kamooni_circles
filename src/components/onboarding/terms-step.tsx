Welcome to Kamooni! Kamooni is a platform designed for building communities, collaborating on projects, and fostering meaningful interactions. It allows you to create and manage Circles—private or public spaces where people can connect, share knowledge, and work together. The platform is still in development, and your participation helps us refine and improve it before the full launch.

- **License to Kamooni**: By posting User Content on the Platform, you grant Kamooni a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to host, display, and distribute your content solely for providing our services.  
- **Content Removal**: If you delete User Content or close your account, we will make reasonable efforts to remove it from the Platform. However, copies or references may remain in cached or archived pages, or if other users have made references to your content.

## 6. User Conduct
You agree that you will not:

## 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Kamooni, its founders, partners, and affiliates from any claims, losses, damages, or legal fees arising out of your use of the Platform, your User Content, or any breach of these Terms.
